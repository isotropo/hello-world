# hello-world
Hi world, I know a little about Linux but very little about Git or about progarmming, so hopefully Github will help me in that area. Electronics Engineering is cool, which is why I made it my major. Big fan of CNLohr's projects. Really smart dude.

What else... I used to be really into Blender, so I'd like to be able to make different github branches of the greater Blender projects. There are some people who have created specialized tools which deviate from the generic Blender path, only to make it into the master branch much much much later. It's always nice to be able to get access to that cutting edge stuff early. For example, there was a website that had brand new versions of different experiemental Blender branches with special sculpting tools. I got the chance to get pretty good with that stuff long before it made it into the master branch. I don't remember the name of the website I found those editions of Blender on, though, so it seems like learning how to use Git would give me a more reliable route to accessing these cool new versions of Blender.
